Product Details:
Clicking on any product will take you to the product details page for that product. All product details are displayed correctly. 
Adding different quantities of objects to the cart is fully functional and working correctly from this page. The carousal of similar products
at the bottom of the page currently only displays products from the same Set as the current selected product. Smarter product selection for the
similar products is planned.
